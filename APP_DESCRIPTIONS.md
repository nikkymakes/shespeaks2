## 📱 SHORT DESCRIPTION (App Store / LinkedIn)

**She Speaks: The Many Faces of Her™** is a four-lens interpretation engine that reimagines biblical women's stories through devotion (Abide 365), identity archetypes (FractaSelf), mythic retelling (The Arc), and holy satire (Satirical Quill™). 

Users enter through emotional pathways—"I feel overlooked," "I'm waiting," "I've made mistakes"—and are matched with women whose stories speak to their season. Drawing from modern biblical translations and the Ethiopian Orthodox canon, the app creates AI-powered interpretations that are reverent yet real, theological yet accessible, ancient yet urgent.

Export as journal PDFs, podcast scripts, or group study guides. Perfect for personal reflection, creative devotion, or biblical education that centers women's voices.

## 📄 FULL DESCRIPTION (Website / Documentation)

### What Is She Speaks?

**She Speaks: The Many Faces of Her™** is an innovative biblical interpretation tool that gives voice to women in scripture—from Hagar to Esther, from Mary Magdalene to Deborah, from the unnamed to the celebrated. 

Unlike traditional Bible study apps, She Speaks doesn't just retell stories. It *reimagines* them through four distinct interpretive lenses, creating a rich, multi-dimensional encounter with each woman's journey:

**🕊 Abide 365 – Spiritual Extraction**  
A devotional reflection that draws out the heart of her story: trials, triumphs, faith, flaws, and the moments of courage that defined her. Each reflection includes modern scripture references and gentle giving prompts.

**🧩 FractaSelf – Identity & Action-Figure Archetype**  
Her essence translated into a symbolic identity (FractaType) with a "Starter Pack" of meaningful items and a modern caption showing how her arc mirrors contemporary personal growth stories. Complete with AI-generated action-figure imagery that reimagines biblical women as collectible icons of resilience.

**🌈 The Arc – Narrative Retelling**  
A timeless allegory stripped of biblical names and verse numbers. Her story becomes myth, fable, fireside tale—accessible to anyone, regardless of religious background, yet preserving the spiritual essence of her transformation.

**🪞 Satirical Quill™ – Holy Roast**  
Witty, reverent commentary that exposes ironies, theological blind spots, and cultural contradictions in how we've told (or silenced) her story. Think Sunday School meets stand-up—clever, layered, never cruel.

### How It Works

**Emotional Entry Points**  
Rather than requiring users to know specific biblical women, She Speaks begins with a simple question: *"What are you walking through right now?"* 

Users can select from phrases like:
- "I feel overlooked and forgotten"
- "I've made mistakes I can't outgrow"
- "I'm being called to lead, but it's lonely"
- "I'm waiting—faithfully, painfully, uncertainly"

The app then matches them with women whose stories resonate with that season, creating immediate relevance and emotional connection.

**Theological Innovation**  
She Speaks draws from modern, accessible translations (NIV, NLT, ESV, NRSV) and explicitly excludes the King James Version to prioritize contemporary language. Uniquely, it incorporates the **Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Bible** (81 books vs. 66 in Protestant canon) and apocryphal texts—honoring African theological traditions and expanding the scope of biblical women's narratives.

**AI-Powered Personalization**  
Using Claude Sonnet 4, the app generates fresh interpretations for any biblical woman—named or unnamed, celebrated or obscure. Each interpretation is unique, contextual, and rooted in the user's current emotional landscape.

### Export & Application

Every interpretation can be downloaded as:
- **PDF Journal Page** – Beautifully formatted for printing and reflection
- **Podcast Script** – Ready for audio recording with opening/closing segments
- **Group Study Guide** – Discussion questions for each lens (coming soon)

### Who Is This For?

**Personal Reflection**  
Women (and men) seeking fresh encounters with biblical narratives that feel relevant, honest, and healing.

**Creative Devotion**  
Writers, artists, and content creators looking for new ways to engage with scripture through satire, allegory, and symbolic imagery.

**Faith Communities**  
Small groups, Bible studies, and retreat facilitators who want discussion material that's both theologically grounded and culturally current.

**Educators & Scholars**  
Teachers introducing biblical literacy through multiple interpretive frameworks—devotional, literary, satirical, archetypal.

**The Spiritually Curious**  
People who appreciate the wisdom in ancient stories but struggle with traditional religious language and gatekeeping.

### Why It Matters

For centuries, women in scripture have been footnotes, plot devices, or moral warnings. Their complexity flattened. Their voices ventriloquized. Their stories told by others.

**She Speaks reclaims narrative authority.** It positions biblical women not as passive subjects but as active agents of their own meaning-making. It allows them to be flawed, funny, fierce, faithful, and fully human.

And it invites modern readers to see themselves—not in sanitized Sunday School versions, but in raw, real, resonant encounters with women who walked through shadows, waiting, mistakes, and callings just like we do.

## 🎤 PODCAST / INTERVIEW DESCRIPTION

**Host Intro Script:**

"Today we're exploring 'She Speaks: The Many Faces of Her,' an innovative app created by Adenike Omoregbee that's reimagining how we encounter biblical women's stories. 

Instead of traditional Bible study, She Speaks uses AI to generate four distinct interpretations of each woman's journey—devotional reflection, identity archetype, mythic retelling, and even holy satire. 

What makes it unique? Users don't need to know biblical names. They start with their own emotions: 'I feel overlooked,' or 'I'm waiting,' or 'I've made mistakes I can't outgrow.' The app then matches them with women whose stories speak to that exact season.

Drawing from the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible and modern translations—explicitly *not* King James—it creates fresh, relevant encounters with women who've been reduced to footnotes for centuries. Each interpretation can be exported as a journal page or podcast script.

It's theology meets technology meets creative storytelling. Let's dive in."
